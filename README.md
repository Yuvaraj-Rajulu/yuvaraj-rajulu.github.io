#### Master Thesis
Title: Human Activity Recognition and Study of Dynamic Filter Networks for Position-aware detection
- Aim: To build a generic framework for Human activity recognition using smartphone Inertial sensors, use of Dynamic Filter generic networks to build a single activity recognition model for multiple positions
- Building Recurrent Neural Network models for multi-variate time series data.
-	Signal pre-processing steps: Design and use of filters for noise and gravitation component removal, data normalization, sensor time-synchronization and sliding window techniques.
-	Study of multi-input, multi-output neural network architectures using concepts of Dynamic Filter Networks.
-	Libraries used: Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit, Pandas among others.
-	Use of Tensorflow profiling to visualize tasks between CPU and GPU to identify performance bottlenecks.
-	Deployment of trained model on an Android smartphone using Tensorflow lite.
