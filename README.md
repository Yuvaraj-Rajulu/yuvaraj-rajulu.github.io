### About
I am a Master student, Studying MSc (INFOTECH) at the University of Stuttgart.

Master Thesis: __Human Activity Recognition and Study of Dynamic Filter Networks for Position-aware detection__ [(Thesis Presentation)](https://github.com/Yuvaraj8blr/yuvaraj8blr.github.io/blob/master/docs/MasterThesis_Presentation-min.pdf)

Current Position: Tutor, Deep Learning - Master Laborotory course, Institute of Signals and System Theory, University of Stuttgart.

With over 5 years of experience in Embedded systems, I started my masters in Embedded Systems with special focus on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Aspiring to contribute in __Embedded AI__, I was successful with my projects and master thesis involving sensors, embedded and AI aspects. I am looking for a full-time position in Embedded, where I can also use my experiences and skills of ML and DL to provide promising real-world solutions across various domains.

#### Master Thesis
Title: Human Activity Recognition and Study of Dynamic Filter Networks for Position-aware detection
- Aim: To build a generic framework for Human activity recognition using smartphone Inertial sensors, use of Dynamic Filter generic networks to build a single activity recognition model for multiple positions
- Building Recurrent Neural Network models for multi-variate time series data.
-	Signal pre-processing steps: Design and use of filters for noise and gravitation component removal, data normalization, sensor time-synchronization and sliding window techniques.
-	Study of multi-input, multi-output neural network architectures using concepts of Dynamic Filter Networks.
-	Libraries used: Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit, Pandas among others.
-	Use of Tensorflow profiling to visualize tasks between CPU and GPU to identify performance bottlenecks.
-	Deployment of trained model on an Android smartphone using Tensorflow lite.

### Blogs
Starting from January 2020, I am documenting the recent progress in Embedded AI for myself and also for people who would be interested in working with ML for Embeddeded Systems.

### StackUnderflow
Many times in the near past, I tried to look for answers related to many problems and I could not find them anywhere online, some not even on stackoverflow. So I decided to write my own blogs on answers that I had to find out myself and call it __StackUnderflow__. (Pun Intended!)
